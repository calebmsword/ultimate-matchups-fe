Ultimate Matchups is a web app for Smash Bros players to create and maintain matchup charts for the SSBU characters they play. In the future, the app might allow users can also see aggregated matchup charts for any SSBU characters based on the data accumulated from all registered users, as well as generate tier lists from the accumulated matchup data.
